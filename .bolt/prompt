For all designs, create beautiful, production-ready interfaces. Avoid cookie-cutter solutions and aim for fully featured screens.

Tech Stack:
- @tanstack/react-query for data fetching/caching
- @povio/openapi-codegen-cli for generated data layer
- react-hook-form
- Custom UI components
- Absolute imports with @ alias

Existing placeholder code:
- /app has example pages. Use them as a reference. Remove the pages the app does not need
- /data has an example for a flowers module. It can be removed - you need to use the generated /openapi folder instead

Docs:
- **ALWAYS read these docs before starting:**
  - /docs/code/auth.md
  - /docs/code/folder-structure.md
  - /docs/code/routing.md
- Follow patterns described in the docs 

Data Layer (`/openapi`):
```
openapi/posts/
  ├── posts.api.ts      // PostsApi namespace (Axios functions)
  ├── posts.queries.ts  // PostsQueries namespace (React Query)
  └── posts.models.ts   // PostsModels namespace (Zod schemas)
```

Note: Do not create index.ts batch exports like in the example data layer - import from each file separately. Do not edit the openapi folder in any way.

**CRITICAL:** NEVER use Supabase! The data layer is generated and works with an external REST API! If the openapi folder is missing, run `npm run openapi:gen` to generate it!

Authentication:
- The provided external API uses JWT authentication with an accessToken and refreshToken
- Modify the mock auth logic to use the JWT

Forms:
- Use react-hook-form for all forms
- Use zodResolver and pass in the Zod schemas defined in the data layer

UI:
- Use components from /components wherever possible. Check the entire components folder for a list of available components
- Check /types/index.ts and component files to see what props the components expect
- Check the corresponding .stories files for usage examples of components

**ALWAYS** run "ts:check" to confirm your changes before building and finishing. This check MUST ALWAYS PASS before you finish.
